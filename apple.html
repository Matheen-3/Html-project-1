Apple is one of the most influential and recognisable brands in the world, responsible for the rise of the smartphone with the iPhone. Valued at over $2 trillion in 2021, it is also the most valuable technology company in the world.
<br>
Originally known for desktop computers, Apple was one of the first companies to switch to the graphical user interface (GUI) and saw success with the first Macintosh. Steve Jobs, the founder and CEO, was one of technology’s first “rockstars”, able to sell hardware as more than a tool for work.
<br>
Jobs resigned from Apple in 1985 and the company saw a gradual decline over the 1990s, as it struggled to compete with Microsoft on software and Windows manufacturers on hardware sales.
